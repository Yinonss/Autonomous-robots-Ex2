# Autonomous-robots-Ex2
Beresheet lunar lander simulation - 2nd assignment in Autonomous Robots course in Ariel University.

### Assignment

A year ago israeli first moon lander Beresheet has reached Moon's orbit but unfortunatly crushed on it.
We were asked to simulate the landing process and suggest a control algorithm which managed to land spacecrafts softly
on the moon's surface.

You're welcome to visit our [task report](https://github.com/Yinonss/Autonomous-robots-Ex2/blob/master/Autonomous%20Robots%20-%20Task%202%20-%20Report.pdf) which we explain about the landing process itself , the reasons Beresheet
didn't manage to land successfully , our solution and our experiment results.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run it on Eclipse.
